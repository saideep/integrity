# Bobette â€” Bob's sister

Bobette is a [Rack][] app that will turn the payload specified
via the `bobette.payload` Rack env key into a buildable object
and then builds it using [Bob][].

You probably don't care about this, though; check out [Integrity][]
for a full fledged automated CI server or the test suite if you do.
